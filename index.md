### Seeking enjoyable, remote employment to further hone backend ruby skills with a like-minded team. Saving lost rails apps since '08 and developing web apps since '01.

## Skills

Beyond the litany of skills that every developer can recite, there are a few
aspects of development that are especially important to me:

**Testing**, specifically test-driven development, is something I'm pretty
passionate about. I've been a fan of rspec as long as it's been around, and I
love it for unit and functional tests. My first "rock star" moment at my first
rails conference in Orlando was meeting Dave Chelimsky. Of late I've become a
fan of minitest.

**Refactoring** – in the service of new features – is another thing I'm
passionate about. During my time at Hashrocket I was known as the guy who'd
take on brownfield projects no one else wanted. Two mantras keep me sane
through any low-quality codebase: "do not stare directly into the code" and
"leave it better than you found it."

**Ruby** is the language I use the most these days. I was reinvigorated upon
discovering Ruby; I love writing code that reads like natural English and
eschew abbreviations and unnecessary symbols when possible.  Ultimately it's
about expressing the most intent to the next developer. Lately I've been
exploring compiled languages like Rust and Go.

## Work Experience

**Senior Software Engineer**  
[Weedmaps](https://weedmaps.com/) – Madison, WI  
May 2019 to August 2022

As a founding member of the Ads squad, I helped write out and eventually took
ownership of the delivery side of our product. Grew the primary ads endpoint to
millions of requests per day, monitoring performance and making adjustments both
proactively and reactively. Provided a standard API for other squads to enable
ads on endpoints they control. Facilitated refactoring our code to match our
growing domain language. Oversaw the beginning of the migration from a
third-party to an in-house decision service.

**Senior Engineer**  
[Adorable IO](https://www.adorable.io) – Madison, WI  
December 2016 to October 2017

Found success for a large project management tool for realtors in the Pacific
Northwest, skipping the big rewrite to refactor and rebuild in sections their
growing application. Led their development team of three, which grew to eight
by the time I left the project, through many performance and usability growing
pains. Facilitated and reviewed acquisition of multiple web properties during
that time. Also took over development of a react native mobile app, web
front-end, and rails back-end for a Madison-based startup.

**Founder**  
Veezus Kreist, Inc – Cleveland, OH and Belleview, FL  
January 2012 to May 2017

Continued working solo with clients I met during my time at Hashrocket,
developing ruby on rails applications and some lightweight front-ends served
via rails backends. Most notably I worked with a small start-up cookbook site
with lucrative publishing rights that was ultimately acquired by Macmillan
Publishers. I ended up dissolving the firm because I missed being part of a
team.


**Ruby on Rails Developer** (informally, Rescue Mission Specialist)  
[Hashrocket](https://hashrocket.com) – Jacksonville, FL and Chicago, IL  
May 2008 to July 2011

Met some of the best developers I've ever worked with at Hashrocket. The
learning environment at that firm is something I've never experienced since.
Worked on several dozen projects, from a two-week MVP to a major multinational
government bidding tool run by an organization in Dubai. Moved to Chicago with
the opening of that office and ended up running day-to-day operations. Attended
meetups incessantly to grow Hashrocket's name recognition, and started and ran
the Vim Chicago meetup.
